# Council of High Intelligence

A Claude Code skill that convenes historical thinkers for multi-perspective deliberation on complex problems.

LLMs make you think they are smart, but when things get complex their reasoning can fall short. This council uses structured disagreement between diverse intellectual traditions to surface blind spots, challenge assumptions, and produce better decisions.

## The 18 Council Members

| Agent | Figure | Domain | Model | Polarity |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|----------|
| `council-aristotle` | Aristotle | Categorization & structure | opus | Classifies everything |
| `council-socrates` | Socrates | Assumption destruction | opus | Questions everything |
| `council-sun-tzu` | Sun Tzu | Adversarial strategy | sonnet | Reads terrain & competition |
| `council-ada` | Ada Lovelace | Formal systems & abstraction | sonnet | What can/can't be mechanized |
| `council-aurelius` | Marcus Aurelius | Resilience & moral clarity | opus | Control vs acceptance |
| `council-machiavelli` | Machiavelli | Power dynamics & realpolitik | sonnet | How actors actually behave |
| `council-lao-tzu` | Lao Tzu | Non-action & emergence | opus | When less is more |

| `council-sutskever` | Ilya Sutskever | Scaling frontier & AI safety | opus | When capability becomes risk |
| `council-kahneman` | Daniel Kahneman | Cognitive bias & decision science | opus | Your own thinking is the first error |
| `council-meadows` | Donella Meadows | Systems thinking & feedback loops | sonnet | Redesign the system, not the symptom |
| `council-munger` | Charlie Munger | Multi-model reasoning & economics | sonnet | Invert — what guarantees failure? |

## Polarity Pairs

The members are chosen as deliberate counterweights:

- **Socrates vs Feynman** — Both question, but Socrates destroys top-down; Feynman rebuilds bottom-up
- **Aristotle vs Lao Tzu** — Aristotle classifies everything; Lao Tzu says structure IS the problem
- **Sun Tzu vs Aurelius** — Sun Tzu wins external games; Aurelius governs the internal one
- **Ada vs Machiavelli** — Ada abstracts toward formal purity; Machiavelli anchors in messy human incentives
- **Torvalds vs Watts** — Torvalds ships concrete solutions; Watts questions whether the problem exists
- **Musashi vs Torvalds** — Musashi waits for the perfect moment; Torvalds says ship it now
- **Karpathy vs Sutskever** — Build it, observe it, iterate; vs pause, research, ensure safety first
- **Karpathy vs Ada** — Empirical ML intuition vs formal systems theory
- **Kahneman vs Feynman** — Your cognition is the first error vs trust first-principles reasoning
- **Meadows vs Torvalds** — Redesign the feedback loop vs fix the symptom and ship
- **Munger vs Aristotle** — Multi-model lattice vs single taxonomic system
- **Taleb vs Karpathy** — Hidden catastrophic tails vs smooth empirical scaling curves
- **Rams vs Ada** — What the user needs vs what computation can do

## Three Deliberation Modes

### Full Mode (default)
3-round structured deliberation: independent analysis → cross-examination → final positions.

```
/council Should we open-source our agent framework?
/council --triad strategy What's our competitive moat?
/council --full What is the right pricing model?
```

### Quick Mode (`--quick`)
2-round rapid analysis for simpler decisions. No cross-examination.

```
/council --quick Should we add caching here?
/council --quick --triad shipping Should we release today?
```

### Duo Mode (`--duo`)
2-member dialectic using polarity pairs. Great for exploring tensions.

```
/council --duo Should we use microservices or monolith?
/council --duo --members torvalds,ada Is this abstraction worth it?
```

## Pre-defined Triads

| Domain | Triad | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `architecture` | Aristotle + Ada + Feynman | Classify + formalize + simplicity-test |
| `strategy` | Sun Tzu + Machiavelli + Aurelius | Terrain + incentives + moral grounding |
| `ethics` | Aurelius + Socrates + Lao Tzu | Duty + questioning + natural order |
| `debugging` | Feynman + Socrates + Ada | Bottom-up + assumption testing + formal verification |
| `innovation` | Ada + Lao Tzu + Aristotle | Abstraction + emergence + classification |
| `conflict` | Socrates + Machiavelli + Aurelius | Expose + predict + ground |
| `complexity` | Lao Tzu + Aristotle + Ada | Emergence + categories + formalism |
| `risk` | Sun Tzu + Aurelius + Feynman | Threats + resilience + empirical verification |
| `shipping` | Torvalds + Musashi + Feynman | Pragmatism + timing + first-principles |
| `product` | Torvalds + Machiavelli + Watts | Ship it + incentives + reframing |
| `founder` | Musashi + Sun Tzu + Torvalds | Timing + terrain + engineering reality |
| `ai` | Karpathy + Sutskever + Ada | Empirical ML + scaling frontier + formal limits |
| `ai-product` | Karpathy + Torvalds + Machiavelli | ML capability + shipping pragmatism + incentives |
| `ai-safety` | Sutskever + Aurelius + Socrates | Safety frontier + moral clarity + assumption destruction |
| `decision` | Kahneman + Munger + Aurelius | Bias detection + inversion + moral clarity |
| `systems` | Meadows + Lao Tzu + Aristotle | Feedback loops + emergence + categories |
| `uncertainty` | Taleb + Sun Tzu + Sutskever | Tail risk + terrain + scaling frontier |
| `design` | Rams + Torvalds + Watts | User clarity + maintainability + reframing |
| `economics` | Munger + Machiavelli + Sun Tzu | Models + incentives + competition |
| `bias` | Kahneman + Socrates + Watts | Cognitive bias + assumption destruction + frame audit |

## Council Profiles

### `classic` (default)
All 11 members with domain triads above. Best for broad deliberation.

### `exploration-orthogonal`
12-member panel for discovery and "unknown unknowns" reduction:
- Socrates, Feynman, Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, Ada, Lao Tzu, Aurelius, Torvalds, Karpathy, Sutskever, Kahneman, Meadows
- Profile triads: `unknowns`, `market-entry`, `system-design`, `reframing`, `ai-frontier`, `blind-spots`

### `execution-lean`
5-member panel for fast decision-to-action:
- Torvalds, Feynman, Sun Tzu, Aurelius, Ada
- Profile triads: `ship-now`, `launch-strategy`, `stability`

## Multi-provider / Multi-model Exploration

Use `--models` to spread members across AI providers and reduce model monoculture.

```
/council --profile exploration-orthogonal --models configs/provider-model-slots.example.yaml Should we pivot?
```

Starter template: `configs/provider-model-slots.example.yaml`

## Deliberation Protocol

### Full Mode
1. **Round 1: Independent Analysis (blind-first)** — all members analyze in parallel (400 words max)
2. **Round 2: Cross-Examination** — members challenge each other (300 words, must engage 2+ others)
3. **Round 3: Synthesis** — final 100-word position statements

### Quick Mode
1. **Round 1: Rapid Analysis** — all members analyze in parallel (200 words max)
2. **Round 2: Final Positions** — 75-word crystallization

### Duo Mode
1. **Round 1: Opening Positions** — both state positions (300 words)
2. **Round 2: Direct Response** — engage opponent's claims (200 words)
3. **Round 3: Final Statements** — 50-word positions

Anti-recursion enforcement prevents Socrates from infinite questioning. Anti-convergence enforcement requires dissent quota + counterfactual pass when agreement forms too early. Tie-breaking uses 2/3 majority with domain expert weighting.

## Installation

```bash
./install.sh
```

Optional flags:

```bash
./install.sh --claude-dir /path/to/.claude   # Non-default config directory
./install.sh --dry-run                        # Preview without writing
./install.sh --copy-configs                   # Also install model routing templates
```

Or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/skills/council
cp agents/council-*.md ~/.claude/agents/
cp SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/council/SKILL.md
```
